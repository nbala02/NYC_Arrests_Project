# Tableau_Project
This project is an extension of the NYC_Arrests project. The goal is to perform basic analysis on the dataset NYPD_Arrest_Data. The purpose of this is to break down the arrests in each borough based on the precise location, the longitude and latitude, in order to determine how different factors such as type of crime, time of the year, sex, and age group of the offenders impact particular areas throughout NYC.

For this version of the project, Tableau Prep was used to prepare the data for visualization and analysis. This was done by filtering out the data and adding calculated fields that were relevant to analyzing the data. Furthermore, the data was split based on the borough. In Tableau Desktop, there were five data sources, one for each borough. For each borough, the latitude and longitude were clustered into 4 clusters to divide the borough into 4 different areas: North, West, South, East. Furthermore, the data was visualized to analyze the arrests in each borough based on the different factors.
